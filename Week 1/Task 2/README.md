# 🧭 Adaptive Sidebar Navigation

> **Difficulty Level:** Beginner  
> **Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
> **Prerequisites:** React fundamentals, CSS/styling, responsive design

## 🎯 Project Overview

Create an intelligent, responsive sidebar navigation system that automatically adapts to different screen sizes and user interactions. The sidebar seamlessly transitions between expanded and collapsed states, providing optimal user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will have mastered:

- **Responsive Design Patterns**: Implement adaptive layouts that respond to viewport changes
- **Conditional Rendering**: Master React's conditional rendering for dynamic UI components
- **State Management**: Handle navigation state and active route tracking
- **CSS Architecture**: Build maintainable, scalable styles with modern CSS techniques
- **Accessibility**: Create keyboard-navigable, screen-reader friendly navigation

| **Sidebar Width**      | 280px (expanded), 64px (collapsed)      | Consistent with Material Design |
| **Animation Duration** | 300ms ease-in-out                       | Smooth, not jarring             |
| **Active State**       | High contrast background + accent color | Clear visual hierarchy          |
| **Hover States**       | Subtle background change                | Interactive feedback            |

### Accessibility Standards

- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for screen readers
