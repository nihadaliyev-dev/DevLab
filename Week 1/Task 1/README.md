# 📊 Configurable Metrics Dashboard

> **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate  
> **Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours  
> **Prerequisites:** React fundamentals, state management, API integration

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build a sophisticated, user-configurable metrics dashboard that allows users to dynamically add, remove, and rearrange metric cards through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The dashboard fetches real-time data from mock APIs and provides persistent layout customization across user sessions.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will have mastered:

- **Dynamic Layout Management**: Implement user-configurable layouts in React with real-time updates
- **Advanced State Management**: Handle complex state for visibility, ordering, and persistent settings
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrate mock API data into responsive UI components
- **Drag-and-Drop UX**: Create smooth, accessible drag-and-drop interactions
- **Data Persistence**: Implement client-side storage solutions for user preferences
